text: The LiveObs subommittee manages the development of the <a href="https://github.com/AppertaFoundation/openeobs/">supported, enterprise edition of OpeneObs</a>. It ensures full and consistent implementation of NHS and Trust policies. LiveObs also facilitates a prompt response to clinical change while flagging and automatically escalating deteriorating patients requiring clinical intervention. The sub-committee chair is Adrian Burke, consultant psychiatrist and CCIO. A member of the CCIO network and of the Royal College of Psychiatrists Informatics Committee, he is interested in how evidence based practice informs the way we develop responsive systems that deliver fast, error-free and effective care to our patients.
