<p></p><h2><b>Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust To Launch Ground-Breaking Electronic System For Prescription And Medications Management</b></h2><p><b>Plymouth Hospitals is the first NHS Trust in England to implement the paperless prescribing and medications administration (ePMA) system OPENeP which will free up clinicians to spend more time providing care to patients.</b></p><p>OPENeP is an open source ePMA solution built on an open standards, vendor-neutral health data repository, Think!EHR PlatformTM, and is a “first of type” implementation for the NHS.</p><p>OPENeP will replace time-consuming manual prescription and medication administration processes. The system uses open, sharable standards and supports the Government’s objective under Personalised Health and Care 2020 to ensure that different technology systems interoperate and data is able to flow seamlessly under the appropriate controls.</p><p>Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, as part of its clinical information system strategy, has formed a partnership with Marand, the Apperta Foundation and CGI to implement the solution which will transform working practices to create a new standard in quality of care and drive greater patient outcomes by putting clinicians at the forefront of the development process.</p><p>Andy Blofield, Director of IM&amp;T (CIO) at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust, said “The Trust has supported an open standards approach to solutions development and delivery for many years and the implementation of a class leading ePMA solution based on this, new to the NHS, openEHR platform represents a significant step towards true data and system independence. We see this as the core building block of our paperless Integrated Digital Care Record and, in collaboration with local and National partners, will encourage the development of a vibrant eco-system which supports local development, promotes organic innovation and application development by SME’s and creates robust partnerships with major commercial partners to implement and support the solution.”</p><p>The OPENeP paperless system will help safeguard both patients and staff when medicines are prescribed and administered by supporting the closed loop medication management. Clinicians will scan the patient wristband to create or retrieve the patient prescription and, once a prescription has been created, it will then be available across the Trust for prescribing, approval and for drugs administration simultaneously.</p><p>The solution will improve patient safety by reducing prescribing and administration errors that could result in adverse drug incidents. It will also improve communication between pharmacists, doctors and nurses, enable work prioritisation, enhance reporting and optimise existing workflows.</p><p>Clinicians at Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust are directly involved in the development of the Marand OPENeP medication management system, working under the custodianship of the Apperta Foundation. The Code4Health clinical community, which is supported by NHS England and NHS Digital, has also collaborated on the project to enhance the established system and assure the safety standards required by UK healthcare communities.</p><p>CGI, as the Trust’s solution integration partner, will oversee the deployment and integration of Marand’s OPENeP at the Trust to support a seamless transition from existing paper-based systems to what will become a truly sustainable open-source standards architecture. Once complete, the solution will drive greater cost savings and operational efficiencies, all while allowing Plymouth to be vendor neutral.</p><h2>Notes to Editors</h2><h3>About Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust</h3><p>Plymouth Hospitals NHS Trust is the largest hospital in the south west peninsula, providing comprehensive secondary and tertiary healthcare.
