At the recent EHI Live in Birmingham, October 31st  we launched our document “Defining an Open Platform” to make the case for open platforms and lay out a blueprint for an open platform architecture at a level of detail that would allow any willing party to build a first generation implementation of an open platform that would be interoperable with any other. Our proposal is based on HL7 FHIR, SNOMED-CT, IHE-XDS and openEHR and draws on pioneering work globally and in the UK that have proven how these standards can be used to build an open platform.

We welcome your comments and feedback which you can send via our Community Innovation Portal <a href="https://community.apperta.org/forums/905251-request-for-comment/suggestions/32077336-defining-an-open-platform">here</a>.
